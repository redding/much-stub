# MuchStub

MuchStub is a stubbing API for replacing method calls on objects in test runs.  This is intended to be brought into testing environments and used in test runs to stub out external dependencies.

All it does is replace method calls.  In general it tries to be friendly and complain if stubbing doesn't match up with the object/method being stubbed:

* each stub takes a block that is called in place of the method
* complains if you stub a method that the object doesn't respond to
* complains if you stub with an arity mismatch
* no methods are added to `Object` to support stubbing

Note: this was originally implemented in and extracted from [Assert](https://github.com/redding/assert).

## Usage

```ruby
# Given this object/API

myclass = Class.new do
  def mymeth; "meth"; end
  def myval(val); val; end
end
myobj = myclass.new

myobj.mymeth
  # => "meth"
myobj.myval(123)
  # => 123
myobj.myval(456)
  # => 456

# Create a new stub for the :mymeth method

MuchStub.(myobj, :mymeth)
myobj.mymeth
  # => StubError: `mymeth` not stubbed.
MuchStub.(myobj, :mymeth){ "stub-meth" }
myobj.mymeth
  # => "stub-meth"
myobj.mymeth(123)
  # => StubError: arity mismatch
MuchStub.(myobj, :mymeth).with(123){ "stub-meth" }
  # => StubError: arity mismatch
MuchStub.stub_send(myobj, :mymeth) # call to the original method post-stub
  # => "meth"

# Create a new stub for the :myval method

MuchStub.(myobj, :myval){ "stub-meth" }
  # => StubError: arity mismatch
MuchStub.(myobj, :myval).with(123){ |val| val.to_s }
myobj.myval
  # => StubError: arity mismatch
myobj.myval(123)
  # => "123"
myobj.myval(456)
  # => StubError: `myval(456)` not stubbed.

# Call to the original method post-stub

MuchStub.stub_send(myobj, :myval, 123)
  # => 123
MuchStub.stub_send(myobj, :myval, 456)
  # => 456

# Unstub individual stubs

MuchStub.unstub(myobj, :mymeth)
MuchStub.unstub(myobj, :myval)

# OR blanket unstub all stubs

MuchStub.unstub!

# Original API is preserved after unstubbing

myobj.mymeth
  # => "meth"
myobj.myval(123)
  # => 123
myobj.myval(456)
  # => 456
```
